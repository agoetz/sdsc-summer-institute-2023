### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 5.2a GPU Computing and Programming

**Date:** Thursday, August 10, 2023

**Summary**: This session introduces massively parallel computing with graphics processing units (GPUs). The use of GPUs is popular across all scientific domains since GPUs can significantly accelerate time to solution for many computational tasks. Participants will be introduced to essential background of the GPU chip architecture and will learn how to program GPUs via the use of libraries, OpenACC compiler directives, and CUDA programming. The session will incorporate hands-on exercises for participants to acquire the basic skills to use and develop GPU aware applications.
