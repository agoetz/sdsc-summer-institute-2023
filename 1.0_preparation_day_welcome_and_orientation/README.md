## Accounts, Login, Environment, Running Jobs and Logging into Expanse User Portal
Marty Kandes, Computational & Data Science Research Specialist, HPC User Services Group

In this virtual session, we'll familiarize you with logging into Expanse with your training account both via the Expane User Portal and directly via SSH. We'll also have you run and test some of the command aliases we've setup in your enviornment on Expanse to make your hands-on work next week at the Summer Institute easier to manage and get started working on the system. 

### Getting your training account and password

You should have recieved an email with the subject line: *HPC & DS 2023 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up*. The contexts of the email should look like the following:

```
Your personalized account information is given below.

Your password is made available through a one-time URL. Be sure to securely record your password immediately since you will not be able to access the URL a third time.

The one-time URL will expire after 14 days, or after 2 viewings, whichever comes first.


    Username: trainXXX (or etrainXXX)
    URL to retrieve password: https://pwpush.security.sdsc.edu/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


As a reminder, we are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we are providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g. environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break.

This training account may be used:
  * Via SSH directly to login.expanse.sdsc.edu
  * Via a special page on the Expanse Portal: https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu/training

For any account user issues/questions, contact consult@sdsc.edu. 
```
