### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 3.6 Linux Tools for File Processing

**Date:** Tuesday, August 8, 2023

**Summary**: Many computational and data processing workloads require pre-processing of input files to get the data into a format that is compatible with the userâ€™s application and/or post-processing of output files to extract key results. While these tasks could be done by hand, the process can be time-consuming, tedious and, worst of all, error prone. In this session we cover the Linux tools awk, sed, grep, sort, head, tail, cut, paste, cat and split, which will help users to easily implement automation.
