## Aliases, symlinks and reservations
For your convenience, we’ve create aliases and symlinks for the Summer Institute
* get-cpu – one interactive compute node for 2 hours
* get-gpu – one interactive GPU (in shared queue) for 2 hours
* start-spark – start one-hour Spark session
* start-tf-cpu – start three-hour TensorFlow session (CPU)
* start-tf-gpu – start three-hour TensorFlow session (GPU)
* data – symlink to staged data
In the event that you need to explicitly use the reservation, training accounts will have access to SI2021RES for duration of SI
