### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 6.1a Parallel Computing using MPI & Open MP 

**Date:** Friday, August 11, 2023

**Summary**: This session is targeted at attendees who are looking for a hands-on introduction to parallel computing using MPI and Open MP programming. The session will start with an introduction and basic information for getting started with MPI. An overview of the common MPI routines that are useful for beginner MPI programmers, including MPI environment set up, point-to-point communications, and collective communications routines will be provided. Simple examples illustrating distributed memory computing, with the use of common MPI routines, will be covered. The OpenMP section will provide an overview of constructs and directives for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization and data scope. Simple examples will be used to illustrate the use of OpenMP shared-memory programming model, and important run time environment variables Hands on exercises for both MPI and OpenMP will be done in C and FORTRAN.
