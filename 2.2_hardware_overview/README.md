### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 2.2 Hardware Overview

**Date:** Monday, August 7, 2023

**Summary**: All users of advanced CI can benefit from a basic understanding of hardware, to determine which factors affect application performance. Here we give an overview starting from CPUs (processors, cores, hyperthreading, instruction sets), the anatomy of a compute node (sockets, memory, attached devices, accelerators), to an overview of cluster architecture (login and compute nodes, interconnects). We also cover how to obtain hardware information using Linux tools, pseudo-filesystems and commonly used hardware utilization monitoring tools.
