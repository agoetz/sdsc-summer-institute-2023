### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 5.1a Performance Tuning

**Date:** Thursday, August 10, 2023

**Summary**: This session is targeted at attendees who both do their own code development and need their calculations to finish as quickly as possible. We will cover the effective use of cache, loop-level optimizations, force reductions, optimizing compilers and their limitations, short-circuiting, time-space tradeoffs and more. Exercises will be done mostly in C, but emphasis will be on general techniques that can be applied in any language.
This session introduces approaches that can be used to perform machine learning at scale. Tools and procedures for executing machine learning techniques on HPC will be presented.  Spark will also be covered for scalable data analytics and machine learning. Please note: Knowledge of fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques is required.

**Presented by:** [Robert Sinkovits](https://www.sdsc.edu/research/researcher_spotlight/sinkovits_robert.html) (rssinkovits @ucsd.edu)
