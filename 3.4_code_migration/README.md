### SDSC Summer Institute 2023
# Session 3.4 Code Migration

**Date:** Tuesday, August 8, 2023

**Summary**: Introduction to porting codes and workflows to SDSC resources. We will cover typical approaches to moving your computations to our resources â€“ use of applications/software packages already available on the system; compiling code from source with information on compilers, libraries, and optimization flags to use; setting up python & R environments on our systems; use of conda based environments; managing workflows; and use of containerized solutions via Singularity.
